Allow me, if you are interested, in sharing some of the decisions I made when designing my personal website (this one).  

Let me make it very clear first. I am no graphical designer. I have never been trained or educated to become a graphical designer. If you have a keen eye, and can tell which typeface I am using on this website in one glance, I guess my declaration is redundant. However, what I do believe myself to be, is simply a builder. I love building things, and I learn tools that are necessary for the job. So learning as much as I could about color theory, typography, layout, spacing, brand importance and user experience has led me to be able to build a website for my own [thoughts](/thoughts/). The necessity of graphical design to this site was apparant during the planning phase.  

Let's run through the planning real quick:

### Purpose:
To present myself to the world via: my inner thoughts and my work, and to provide it with ways to get a hold of me.
**Decision**: Three pages besides the front page: [Thoughts](/thoughts/), [Apps](/apps/), and [Contact](/contact/).  

### Target Audience:
Anyone who understands even a little bit about programming.  
**Decision**: Logo can have syntax in it. It's unique, shows what I am about, and only relevant to users that I am targetting.

### Emotions to be generated:
To show that I am full of <span class="orange">energy</span> and yet <span class="blue">intelligent</span> enough to make good decisions.  
**Decision**: Color pallete of orange and blue to [create the mood](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/28/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/) along with white for simplicity and trust. A reccomended emotion for any professional.

### First page impression:
To greet the world, and introduce myself. Along with a picture without smiling like a dork.  
**Decision**: Photo of self looking at the greeting. [Trustworthiness](http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/human-landing-page-increase-conversion-rate/) + [attention](http://usableworld.com.au/2009/03/16/you-look-where-they-look/) directed towards the end goal.

### More (Typography, spacing, etc..):
[Get in touch](/contact/)! I would love to take you through, and show off, all the remaining little decisions that I have made on my website!
